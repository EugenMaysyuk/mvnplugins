Attached Artifacts

  By default, the plugin will replace the project's main artifact with the uber artifact. If both the original and
  the uberized artifact should be installed/deployed to the repository, one can configure the plugin to attach the
  uber artifact as a secondary artifact.  The uberized artifact is distinguished from the main artifact by means 
  of the additional classifier.  The classifier defaults to 'uber'.

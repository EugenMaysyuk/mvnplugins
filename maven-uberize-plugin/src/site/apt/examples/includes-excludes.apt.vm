Jar Selection and Filtering

* <<<\<artifactSet\>>>>

  The <<<\<artifactSet\>>>> option can be used to select which artifact dependencies should be 
  included/excluded in the uber jar.  
  
  <<<\<includes\>>>> are used to specify a white list of artifacts and <<<\<excludes\>>>> are used 
  to remove artifacts that are being included.. 
  
  Artifacts are denoted by a composite identifier of the form <groupId>:<artifactId>[:<classifier>].

  <Example>:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.fusesource.mvnplugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-uberize-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>uberize</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <artifactSet>
                <excludes>
                  <exclude>classworlds:classworlds</exclude>
                  <exclude>junit:junit</exclude>
                  <exclude>jmock:jmock</exclude>
                  <exclude>xml-apis:xml-apis</exclude>
                </excludes>
              </artifactSet>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>

* <<<\<filters\>>>>

  Additionally, The <<<\<filters\>>>> option can be used for fine-grained control of the classes 
  and resources that are included int the uber jar.
  
  Ant-like patterns in the <<<\<include\>>>> and <<<\<exclude\>>>> are used to specify which 
  classes and resources should be included in the uber jar.

  <Example>:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.fusesource.mvnplugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-uberize-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>uberize</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <filters>
                <filter>
                  <artifact>junit:junit</artifact>
                  <includes>
                    <include>junit/framework/**</include>
                    <include>org/junit/**</include>
                  </includes>
                  <excludes>
                    <exclude>org/junit/experimental/**</exclude>
                    <exclude>org/junit/runners/**</exclude>
                  </excludes>
                </filter>
              </filters>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...

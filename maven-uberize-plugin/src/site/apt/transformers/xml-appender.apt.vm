XML Appender

  Merges multiple XML documents.  It starts with the fist XML document and then merges 
  subsequent documents by appending the children of it's root element into the the first 
  document's root.

  The transformer use ant-like patterns to <<<\<include\>>>> and <<<\<exclude\>>>> the 
  resources that you want the transformation to apply to.

  <Example>:

  <transformer implementation="org.fusesource.mvnplugins.uberize.transformer.XmlAggregator"/>
    <includes>

      <include>foo/**/*.xml</include>
    </includes>
    <excludes>
      <exclude>foo/dont-touch.xml</exclude>
    </excludes>
  </transformer>

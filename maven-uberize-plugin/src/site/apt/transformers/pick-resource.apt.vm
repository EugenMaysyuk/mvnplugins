Pick Resource

  If you have overlapping resources in your uber jar, and you DON'T want to merge them, you should
  add in this transformer.  It will at least get rid of the warning the plugin logs out when 
  it detects overlapping resources.  The transformer also gives you a little more flexibility about
  which overlapped resource gets picked.

  You should set the <<<\<pick\>>>> option to either <<<first>>> or <<<last>>>.
  
  The transformer use ant-like patterns to <<<\<include\>>>> and <<<\<exclude\>>>> the 
  resources that you want the transformation to apply to.

  <Example>:

  ...
  <transformer implementation="org.fusesource.mvnplugins.uberize.transformer.PickResource"/>
    <pick>first</pick>
    <includes>
      <include>images/**/*.jpg</include>
    </includes>
  </transformer>

Maven Avero Plugin

  This plugin provides the capability to compile Avro schema and protocol definitions as part of your maven build.  

* Usage

  Use the example below to add it to your project's <<<pom.xml>>>:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.fusesource.mvnplugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-avro-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${current-version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----
 
  Then place your Avro files in the <<<src/main/avro>>> or <<<src/test/avro>>> directories.
  
   * Avro schema definitions MUST use a <<<.avsc>>> file extension
   
   * Avro protocol definitions MUST use a <<<.avpr>>> file extension
   
  
  The generated Java source file's name will be based on camel case translation of the original file name of the Avro defintion.
   
  See the {{{./compile-mojo.html}compile goal reference}} for the full list of configuration options that it supports.

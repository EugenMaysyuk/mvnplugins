Text Aggregator

  Some jars contain additional resources (such as properties files) that have the same file name.  
  One good example for this is when aggregating both the spring-context and plexus-spring jars. Both 
  of them have the <<<META-INF/spring.handlers>>> file which is used by Spring to handle XML schema 
  namespaces. 
  
  This transformer concatenates user configured resource files.  If the text file does not end in 
  a newline, it will introduce a newline for you so that you don't end up with last line and the first
  line of the next file on one line.

  The transformer use ant-like patterns to <<<\<include\>>>> and <<<\<exclude\>>>> the resources that you 
  want the transformation to apply to.
  
  <Example>:

    <excludes>
      <exclude>META-INF/foo/dont-touch.properties</exclude>
    </excludes>
  </transformer>
